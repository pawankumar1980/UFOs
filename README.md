# UFOs

## Background

Dana's webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she'd like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria simultaneously. In addition to the date, we'll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

### UFO Sightings

### Appearance of Filters on the Landing Page

## Landing Page when One of the filters are used

Here, we have used the "shape" filter with the option "formation". We get a total of 5 entries as seen in the image above. All the entries need to be written in lower case and for resetting we need to delete the entry and click outside the filter tab.

## Summary

### Drawbacks

The search field is "case-sensitive." The table will not update if you do not enter precisely how the data is stored and does not allow for partial entries. This issue is because it does not intuitively tell the user how the information should be entered other than the "default" example shown.

The data is limited and outdated since it is not linked to a "live" source.

### Recommendations

Add additional customizations, such as click-buttons, dropdown lists, and auto-fill, to help "guide" the user and make the page more interactive.

Add functionality to pull the data from a live source that includes current and archived data not limited to the United States but globally.
