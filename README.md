# UFOs

## Background

Dana's webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she'd like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria simultaneously. In addition to the date, we'll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
